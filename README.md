### Description:
- [x] In this project, I use **Python** and a **machine learning** technique called **linear regression** to predict the future prices of Netflix stocks.
- [x] My goal was to guess where stock prices might go based on what happened in the past.
- [x] To do this, I gather historical data from a platform called **Kaggle**. I then _clean_ and _organize_ this data so that it's ready for my model to use. Think of it like getting all the puzzle pieces in the right order before solving the puzzle.
- [x] I rely on data and algorithms to make informed predictions. This can help investors and analysts to make smarter decisions when it comes to buying or selling Netflix stocks.

### Toolkit:

1. **Python**: Our primary programming language for data analysis, machine learning.
2. **Linear Regression Algorithm**: The key machine learning technique used to predict stock prices based on historical data.
3. **Kaggle**: The platform from which we collect historical stock market data for our analysis.
4. **Data Preprocessing**: A set of data cleaning and transformation techniques to make the data suitable for our model.
5. **Machine Learning Model**: The heart of our project, which applies algorithms to historical data to make predictions about future stock prices.
